# Membership Service Provider

## What is MSP?

- MSP 

  ### Key Points

- Membership Service Provider Play huge role in Hyperledger.
- help to create a shared ledger among all of the different organizations that are part of the network. 
- These are companies that hold special access rights to allow them to do transactions with other organizations in the network. If you’re interested in learning more about Hyperledger, you can check out their website here. 
- They have numerous articles about their projects and even an entire section for developers who are interested in helping them build applications for their network.

## MSP Configuration

-The membership service providers play the function of the middleman between organizations that want to participate in a network and those that want to use their services. 
- This service is used by Hyperledger to set up the rules of engagement and make sure that there is an agreement between the two sides.
- Hyperledger has a shared ledger that is hosted by several MSPs within their network.
- Both the organizations that are joining the network and those companies who are already members of it have access to the ledger, which helps keep track of all of the transactions that go on in it. 
- One of the biggest benefits of this system is not having to attribute any transactions to any one business participating in it. The transactions become a part of all ledgers, which means that no single company owns them. Ted Livingston, the CEO of Kik, said it best when he said: “The blockchain is a ladder that can take you out of the orphanage.” All business information on this network is automatically logged and tracked to ensure that there are no discrepancies or inconsistencies between all of the companies using and servicing each other.
-Hyperledger’s MSPs must adhere to standards that have been created by the Hyperledger community. These standards set forth specific rules for transactions and interactions within the ledger so that all participants know exactly what to expect from each other. This ensures that transactions and interactions between businesses utilizing this technology will always run smoothly.

- To set up an instance of MSP, the configuration needs to be specified locally at each peer, orderer, and on the channels.
- In order to refer MSP to the network, a name needs to be specified. This is known as MSP ID or MSP Identifier.
- MSP ID must be unique for each MSP instance.
- A set of parameters needs to be specified to allow for identity validation and signature verification in case of the default implementation of MSP.
